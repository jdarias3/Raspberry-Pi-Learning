# React on Raspberry Pi

## Installation

1. sudo apt-get install nodejs npm

To validate the version
nmp -v
node -v

If you use VS Code as your editor, I suggest you, the following extensions extensions for React:

1. Simple React Snippet
2. Prettier - Code formatter

Prettier will reformat after you save your file, to do so, we need to perform an extra step:

1. Go to File > Preferences > Settings
2. On the search bar, type *formatOnSave* and mark this option.

**To Create a Project**

```$create-react-app <name>```

It will install a development srver , webpack and babel to compile javascript

After instalation, to lunch the application use the command:

````npm start run```
